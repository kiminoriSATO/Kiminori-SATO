Since April 2007, I joined Watanabe Research Group and opened to public many research results.
In April 2013, I promoted to a professor and it is determination working on further education and research. 
In April 2016, our SATO laboratory was received Dr. Fukumoto(Research Associate). 
Main research target is studied : biometrics identification, time-varying image processing, 
image measurement,etc.. For the development, the creative system has mainly been constructed 
using C language. Not only programming but also manufacturing of the hardware using the 
various sensor. SBRA2016 excellent presentation award was received in symposium on biometrics, 
recognition and authentication (SBRA2016). The theme itself was supported by 
the research budget of Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (2010 - 2012) and 
the patent application was also carried out. As other applied patent, 
there are Lip-sync personal authentication system using movement feature of lip, 
Identification system based on the dentition image analysis, Non-contacting security key 
entry system using the shape of the hand, Identification by the air signature, Personal 
authentication using omnidirectional fist Image, Quantification of the walk improvement 
degree with the walk rehabilitation, PIN code input system strong to multiple shoulder 
hacking, etc.. <br
In 2014, 8 patent applications already submitted 
(see http://www.ibe.kagoshima-u.ac.jp/~fics/research/satou_kiminori/) <br>
                   
Main participation society is Meeting on Image Recognition and Understanding (MIRU), 
Symposium on Biometrics, Recognition and Authentication (SBRA), Pattern recognition 
and Media Understanding (PRMU) of IEICE, Computer Vision and Image Media (CVIM) of 
IPSJ, etc.. We are looking forward to meeting and discussing with you!
